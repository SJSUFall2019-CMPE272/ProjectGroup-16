### 3 Proposed Project Ideas:

**Predict the possibility of power outage under certein weather condition.**

- Project idea description : 
    
    We discovered a group of datasets on kaggle that have the data about 15 years 
    of power outages across the United States. It would be interesting to predict the 
    possiblilty of power outage under certein weather condition. 
    
    First, Analyze the most common causes for the power outage and how it impact 
    correlated to the historical weather data from IBM The Weather Company. 
    According to the data, we can then predict the possibility of power outages under 
    certain weather condition (eg. raining, sunny, ice, windy, etc.) and estimate 
    how many people in that region will be affected.

- Goal of the project (who are your developing the project for) :

  Develop a web application that take in weather condition from weather forecast 
  and response with predicted possibility of power outages. 
  
  This web application is designed for the people who have concern if they will
  have power outage in their living area.

**Predict the home value based on the education**

- Project idea description : 
    
    There are so many factors to affect your home value/your rent. One of the factors 
    is about the quality of education. There is a groups of datasets on Kaggle about 
    the student performance on 4th grad and 8th grade in math an reading exams across
    United States. Those test scorce is playing important role to identify if the 
    school are providing good quality of education. 
    
    We thought of using those data as a quality of education in the location.
    Then we found Zillow is providing research data of home value.
     

- Goal of the project (who are your developing the project for) :

  Develop a web application that take in the zipcode/county and response with the predicted home price
  in the corresponding area.
  
    This web application is designed for the people who would like to buy house/rent place 
    either for their kids to have better education or worth to buy/rent.
