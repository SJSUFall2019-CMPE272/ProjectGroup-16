APPROVED - HomeValue - predict the home value (read below)
yesterday there was a news that Trader Joe and Whole foods are contributing to the rise in proce of homes in the area. This is interesting because a) people wants to live in walking distance to these organic grocery stores b) more house owners may be looking to NOT own cars etc,,,
why dont you combine education, healthy habits, millenial trends and other metrics to provide house buying guides for users.

### 3 Proposed Project Ideas:

#### 1. Predict the possibility of power outage under certein weather condition

- Project idea description : 
    
    We discovered a group of datasets on kaggle that have the data about 15 years 
    of power outages across the United States. It would be interesting to predict the 
    possiblilty of power outage under certein weather condition. 
    
    First, Analyze the most common causes for the power outage and how it impact 
    correlated to the historical weather data from IBM The Weather Company Data. 
    According to the data, we can then predict the possibility of power outages under 
    certain weather condition (eg. raining, sunny, ice, windy, etc.) and estimate 
    how many people in that region will be affected.

- Goal of the project (who are your developing the project for) :

  Develop a web application that take in weather condition from weather forecast 
  and response with predicted possibility of power outages. 
  
  This web application is designed for the people who have concern if they will
  have power outage in their living area. 


- Technology stack :

  FrontEnd: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular/React

  BackEnd: Python
  
  Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn


#### 2. Spam Email

- Project idea description :

    We found a dataset on Kaggle which include 3000 emails which have been classified as either
    spam or not spam. We think it would be fun to build a web application where users can copy
    and paste the contents of an email, and the application will attempt to predict whether the
    email is spam or not.

- Goal of the project :

    Create a machine learning model for predicting whether or not an email is spam. Then use the
    model to develop a web application for predicting whether or not an email is spam. Anyone who
    has received an email they are unsure about can paste its contents into the web application and
    hopefully find out whether or not it is spam.

- Technology stack :

    Frontend: Angular or React/Redux.

    Backend: Python/Flask

    Machine Learning: NLTK

#### 3. Predict the home value based on the education

- Project idea description : 
    
    There are so many factors to affect your home value/your rent. One of the factors 
    is about the quality of education. There is a groups of datasets on Kaggle about 
    the student performance on 4th grad and 8th grade in math an reading exams across
    United States. Those test scorce is playing important role to identify if the 
    school are providing good quality of education. 
    
    We thought of using those data as a quality of education in the location.
    Then we found Zillow is providing research data of home value.
     

- Goal of the project (who are your developing the project for) :

  Develop a web application that take in the zipcode/county and response with the predicted home price
  in the corresponding area.
  
    This web application is designed for the people who would like to buy house/rent place 
    either for their kids to have better education or worth to buy/rent.
