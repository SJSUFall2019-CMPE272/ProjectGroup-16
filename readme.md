### 3 Proposed Project Ideas:

**Predict the possibility of power outage under certein weather condition.**

- Project idea description : 
    
    We discovered a group of datasets on kaggle that have the data about 15 years of power outages 
    with location.
    We thought of comparing those data with the weather data from IBM The Weather Company and see if 
    we can predict the power outage under certain weather.

- Goal of the project (who are your developing the project for) :

  Develop a web application that take in weather condition and response with predicted possibility of power outages


- Technology stack :

  FrontEnd: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular/React, Bootstrap, Material Design

  BackEnd: Python

**spam email**

- Project idea description :

    We found a dataset on Kaggle which include 3000 emails which have been classified as either
    spam or not spam. We think it would be fun to build a web application where users can copy
    and paste the contents of an email, and the application will attempt to predict whether the
    email is spam or not.

- Goal of the project :

    Create a machine learning model for predicting whether or not an email is spam. Then use the
    model to develop a web application for predicting whether or not an email is spam. Anyone who
    has received an email they are unsure about can paste its contents into the web application and
    hopefully find out whether or not it is spam.

- Technology stack :

    Frontend: Angular or React/Redux.

    Backend: Python/Flask

    Machine Learning: NLTK

**Predict the home value based on the education**
Project idea description

- Project idea description : 

We discovered a group of datasets on kaggle that have the data student performance on 4th grade and 8th grade in math and reading exams.
We thought of using those data as a quality of education in the location.
Then we found Zillow is providing research data of home value.
